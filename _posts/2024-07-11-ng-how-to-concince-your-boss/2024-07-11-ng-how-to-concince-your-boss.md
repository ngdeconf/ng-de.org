But now you ask yourself, how you get your boss to agree to buy that ticket and convince them that your visit is beneficial for both you and your company. Look no further. We have the perfect arguments for you!

### Why Attend the NG-DE Conference?

**1. Professional Development:** The NG-DE Conference is a prime opportunity for professional growth. With **30 expert speakers and trainers** and **5 hands-on workshops**, you will gain insights into the latest trends and best practices in Angular development. This knowledge can be directly applied to your current projects, leading to more efficient and innovative solutions.

**2. Networking Opportunities:** Meeting with over **800 developers** and industry leaders provides invaluable networking opportunities. These connections can lead to collaborations, partnerships, and even potential clients. Networking at such a scale is difficult to achieve in a regular work environment.

**3. Recruiting Benefits:** Attending NG-DE Conference can enhance your company's recruiting efforts. By being present at the conference, your company can attract top talent who are also attending. It’s an excellent chance to promote your company as a forward-thinking, developer-friendly workplace and a great way of covering the internal lack of skilled workers.

**4. Promote Your Company:** Whether it's showcasing your latest product, service, or simply spreading brand awareness, the NG-DE Conference offers a platform to promote your company. Engaging with the developer community can lead to increased visibility and recognition within the industry.

### Guide: How to Present Your Case to Your Boss

**1. Prepare a Strong Proposal:** Start by outlining the benefits mentioned above in a clear and concise proposal. Highlight how the knowledge and connections gained from the conference will directly benefit your projects and the company.

**2. Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Provide a detailed cost-benefit analysis. Include the cost of the conference ticket, travel, and accommodation, but also emphasize the return on investment. Mention the potential for improved project outcomes, new business opportunities, and recruiting advantages.

**3. Offer to Share Knowledge:** Commit to sharing the knowledge gained with your team. Propose to hold a presentation or workshop after the conference to disseminate the insights and best practices you’ve learned.

**4. Highlight Success Stories:** Share case studies or testimonials from previous conference attendees. Show how other professionals have benefited from attending similar events and how their companies have seen positive outcomes.

**5. Explore Sponsorship:** If the budget for personal conference tickets is exhausted, consider the option of **sponsorship**. Sponsoring the NG-DE Conference not only provides great marketing exposure but also includes conference tickets in every sponsorship package, providing a dual benefit of marketing exposure and team development.

### Handling a "No" and Turning it into a "Yes"

**1. Understand the Objections:** If your boss initially says no, seek to understand their concerns. Is it the cost? The time away from work? Understanding their objections allows you to address them directly.

**2. Offer Alternatives:** Suggest alternative ways to minimize costs, such as early bird tickets, sharing accommodation, or finding cheaper travel options. Show that you’re considerate of the company’s budget.

**3. Demonstrate Long-Term Benefits:** Emphasize the long-term benefits over the short-term costs. Explain how the skills and connections made at the conference will pay off in future projects and initiatives.

**4. Propose a Trial:** If the cost is a major concern, suggest attending the conference as a trial. Offer to cover some of the costs yourself as an investment in your career, showing your commitment to professional growth.

**5. Highlight Sponsorship Benefits:** If the personal development budget is exhausted, highlight the benefits of conference sponsorship. Explain how it fits into the marketing budget and provides additional value through brand exposure, networking, and included tickets.
