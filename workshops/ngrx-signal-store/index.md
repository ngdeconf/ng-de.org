description: >
  Explore the power of NgRx SignalStore in a comprehensive workshop led by a core member of the NgRx team: Alex Okrushko. This workshop offers a deep dive into the world of reactive state management powered by Angular Signals.
  NgRx SignalStore offers a pragmatic approach to state management in Angular applications. With its native support for Signals, you can define stores in a clear and declarative manner. The simplicity and flexibility of SignalStore, coupled with its opinionated and modular design, make it a versatile choice for Angular developers.
  What to Expect:
  In this workshop, weâ€™ll walk through the fundamentals of the NgRx SignalStore with in-depth discussions, exercises, and code labs. We'll guide you through leveraging the power of both Signals and RxJS, showing you how to use each in the places where they shine, unlocking the full potential of reactivity in Angular. After exploring core concepts, we'll delve into using SignalStore plugins and architectural patterns that ensure code cleanliness, scalability, and robustness.
  Prerequisites:
  Participants should have a basic understanding of Angular and TypeScript fundamentals. Experience with NgRx and Signals is not required but would be beneficial.
