        'This workshop guides you through a carefully structured curriculum where each topic builds upon the previous one, providing a progressive experience from foundational concepts to advanced techniques:\n\n' +
        '- Exploring Angular Signals APIs to establish the technical foundation for what follows\n' +
        '- Mastering SignalStore core principles and main building blocks\n' +
        '- Integrating RxJS with SignalStore to combine the best of both reactive approaches\n' +
        '- Building custom SignalStore features that consolidate common patterns into reusable abstractions\n' +
        '- Using the Entities plugin to facilitate data collection management\n' +
        '- Applying architectural patterns for managing local and global state in complex applications\n' +
        '- Utilizing the new Events plugin for orchestrating complex workflows with elegance\n\n' +

The new Resource API, along with the httpResource, adds an essential piece to this story by providing an official solution for asynchronously loading data within a Signal-based dataflow.\n\nIn this session, we explore all the details you need to work effectively with this powerful API. Topics include managing different states, handling errors, streaming data, preventing race conditions, and canceling unnecessary requests. We also discuss how it interacts with RxJS through rxResource and demonstrate how to update loaded values.\n\nBy the end, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of the possibilities offered by this groundbreaking new API.",

How does the team make sure there\'s a steady stream of features without overwhelming users? This talk offers a look behind the scenes at how the Angular team operates. Jens will explain how the team gathers and analyzes data from different sources to make decisions, how we prioritize features and the trade-offs involved to build the most intuitive, performant and scalable framework for building web apps.',
