Instead of installing black-box components, spartan gives you the actual code—meant to be copied, customized, and fully owned. In this talk, we'll explore the philosophy behind spartan, how its CLI empowers fast scaffolding of customizable components, and why open code is the future of frontend architecture. Build faster. Style freely. Own every line.",
