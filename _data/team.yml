    After finishing my studies in the fields of biotechnology I realized quite fast, that this is not the area I would love to work in. It was a great decision to change my professional orientation and start working as a software developer. While I have much experience with databases and back-end development, I am always eager to learn something new. I started to learn Angular some months ago and with my fascination for what I have learned so far, I am curiously looking forward to discover even more exciting things about this framework.
