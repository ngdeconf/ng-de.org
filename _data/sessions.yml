  title: Angular Architecture Workshop - Nx, Micro Frontends, and Signal Store
  logo: router.svg
  description: >
    In this interactive workshop, we utilize the latest Angular features to implement a modern and maintainable architecture. We start with Standalone Components and discuss approaches to modularization without NgModules, such as monorepos, Nx, and Sheriff. 
    Then, we explore the potential of Micro Frontends. We discuss when they make sense and how to implement them using web standards, the Angular CLI’s new esbuild support, and Module Federation or Native Federation. 
    We proceed with Signals, local change detection, and Zone-less Angular. Subsequently, we integrate the new Signal Store to establish modern and lightweight state management. Thanks to its custom features, we can use the Signal Store to implement recurring, complex requirements with just a few lines of code. 
    By the end, you'll be equipped to design modern and maintainable Angular solutions.

  logo: ngrx.svg
  description: >
    Explore the power of NgRx SignalStore in a comprehensive workshop led by a core member of the NgRx team: Alex Okrushko. This workshop offers a deep dive into the world of reactive state management powered by Angular Signals.
    NgRx SignalStore offers a pragmatic approach to state management in Angular applications. With its native support for Signals, you can define stores in a clear and declarative manner. The simplicity and flexibility of SignalStore, coupled with its opinionated and modular design, make it a versatile choice for Angular developers.
    What to Expect:
    In this workshop, we’ll walk through the fundamentals of the NgRx SignalStore with in-depth discussions, exercises, and code labs. We'll guide you through leveraging the power of both Signals and RxJS, showing you how to use each in the places where they shine, unlocking the full potential of reactivity in Angular. After exploring core concepts, we'll delve into using SignalStore plugins and architectural patterns that ensure code cleanliness, scalability, and robustness.
    Prerequisites:
    Participants should have a basic understanding of Angular and TypeScript fundamentals. Experience with NgRx and Signals is not required but would be beneficial.

    Generative AI is on everyone's lips: Adobe Photoshop allows objects in images to be exchanged by simply entering a prompt, and Microsoft Copilot has come to Office and Windows. 
    With WebLLM and WebSD, we can now bring Generative AI to your Angular app: entirely local and offline-capable. 
    We generate images from text input and add a chatbot to a to-do application. If you want to code along, please bring a powerful device with Windows or macOS, a current version of Chrome, Node.js, an editor of your choice, and at least 10 GB of free hard disk space. 
    Ideally, this should be your private device, as group policies or company proxies may cause issues.

  description: >
    Single page application were known to be bloated and send way too much javascript to start.
    This is why frameworks started to recommend Lazy-loading : Sending the minimum to start the app.
    With Server Side Rendering (SSR) + Partial hydration, it is now possible to send even less and still have content rendered on the client.
    Let’s dive into this new feature in Angular v18.x (TBD), how the magic works, the uses cases for your apps and what performances improvements to expect !

    Microfrontends are a popular concept to simplify development in an enterprise project, where a large number of teams want to work independently.
    Ideally, at run-time we can orchestrate multiple independent parts to obtain a seamless application.
    Some real life experience with different integration patterns, using Angular Elements and Module Federation will demonstrate the challenges to be solved.
    Especially with multiple instances of the Angular Router you might encounter some pitfalls and limitations which are not obvious at first sight. This talk will demonstrate how a solution can still be achieved.

  title: Cut My Task Into Pieces - This is Concurrent Mode
  description: >
    JavaScript is single threaded. Every script our application executes runs on the main thread. Keeping the execution time as short as possible is crucial for the runtime performance and responsiveness of our applications. Too long running scripts will result in bad (Core) Web Vitals like INP and TBT. Reducing the computation time of function executions of course is the desired solution, but often not possible or the most costly option. 
    In this talk, we’ll uncover another solution to this problem, the Concurrent Mode. Having profound knowledge about how to orchestrate work on the main thread is key to understanding how the Concurrent Mode works. We’ll start with a deep dive into the JavaScript Event Loop and explore the characteristics of different scheduling techniques. 
    Building up on the scheduling techniques, I will explain how to implement a custom scheduler. It enables to prioritize and execute work with the notion of frames, allowing the browser to render the application at a configurable frames per second rate.
    Finally, we’ll wrap things up with a live demonstration on how to apply the Concurrent Mode to angular applications. We’ll progressively improve the (Core) Web Vitals INP and TBT on this journey.
    The Live Demo also covers how this technique integrates nicely with the upcoming zoneless features introduced with Angular 17+

  title: Pride and Prejudice - Template Driven Forms
  description: >
    What have we always said over the years? What might be easier to retell what most of the Angular community has told us without trying it out for yourself?
    "Template driven forms don't scale", "If you have large complex forms, then you need to use reactive forms"
    Hand on heart - were reactive forms that simple and straightforward to use?
    Well, not for me.
    That's why in this session I'm going to contrast Reactive Forms and Template Driven Forms and cover the following topics:
    - Boilerplate
    - Automatic validation
    - Asynchronous validation
    - Conditional form elements
    - Managing form states
    - Unidirectional data flow in forms with the help of signals
    The aim is to come to an honest and well-founded comparison in order to better weigh up reactive forms and template-driven forms in the future.
    After all, we all want to be able to use forms as effectively as possible, right?

    In this talk we will show how you can use Angular Dev Tools alongside the standard Dev Tools and Web Vitals Extension to identify and resolve performance issues.
    There are some hidden gems within Dev Tools profiling panel that goes beyond just measuring how much time is spent executing a function and we will discover them together.
